		#SOL-STEREO-titl = Super Technical Electronic Ranged Emission Observer (STEREO)
		#SOL-STEREO-descr = The KMI's older brother, the Super Technical Electronic Ranged Emission Observer was invented when our CEO learned to count to two and realized that two is better than one. However, he then refused to count any higher, cancelling all further observatories and forcing our scientists put the rest of the tubes on here. Now in color!

	// #KMI
		#SOL-KMI-titl =  Kerbolic Magnetic Imager (KMI)
		#SOL-KMI-descr = Originally built to find magnets in our warehouses, the Kerbolic Magnetic Imager's current purpose was discovered when an employee looked straight at Kerbol and saw...science. Also doubles as a projector! For best results, point at Kerbol. Warranty void if used in orbit around another celestial body or too far away.
