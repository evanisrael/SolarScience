description = Originally built to find magnets in our warehouses, the Kerbolic Magnetic Imager's current purpose was discovered when an employee looked straight at Kerbol and saw...science. Also doubles as a projector! For best results, point at Kerbol. Warranty void if used in orbit around another celestial body or too far away.
