description = The KMI's older brother, the Super Technical Electronic Ranged Emission Observer was invented when our CEO learned to count to two and realized that two is better than one. However, he then refused to count any higher, cancelling all further observatories and forcing our scientists put the rest of the tubes on here. Now in color!
